## Programs

### Krita

Krita is a free open source art program that works everywhere except on iOS. Its the main art program I use on my Linux and Windows devices. It also works on Android and MacOS. 

I have experienced no flaws in Krita so far and its used by plenty of artists.

## Huion 

### KAMVAS 16 Gen 3 : 

I strongly recommend getting something like this if your into digital art. I haven't really done are on an Ipad so I cant speak for that community though this is much nicer than on my laptop. 

It works on any computer that has HDMI and two USB A ports or a Thunderbolt port and a USB A port.

### KAMVAS Slate 11 : 

This is a stand alone art tablet smiler to the KAMVAS 16 Gen 3.

Its a bit cheaper and doesn't require and outside device to run it.
